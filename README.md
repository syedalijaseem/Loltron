- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Loltron
- Iâ€™m interested in mainly web development(full stack).
- I like to build apps with python, java and c++.
- Iâ€™m currently learning full stack web development.
- Currently, I'm learing a lot as I'm exploring the vast field of web development.
- My goal is to build a few web applications using the full stack web development knowledge that I'll gain and then later switch to mainly front-end or back-end web development based off preferance.
